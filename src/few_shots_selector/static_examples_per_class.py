Guess what, there have been less severe floods and more severe floods and no floods at all and nothing has changed. Did anthropogenic CO2 cause the floods in 1893 perhaps? Hang on, lets get the script right : No direct link between global warming and the 1893 floods, but climate change would lead to heavier, more frequent rain. Unspoken conclusion: leading to more floods like the one we just happen by chance to be talking about right now Thats the sneaky thing about flood plains, they flood duh.",

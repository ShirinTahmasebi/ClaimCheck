In this case, daytime mixing would bring down the lower humidity air to the surface from the same altitude as before. There is some radiosonde evidence for such a decrease in absolute humidities above the turbulent boundary layer (e.g. Paltridge, 2009 ). If real, such a decrease might well result in negative water vapor feedback, since a small decrease in mid- and upper tropospheric humidity can have a natural radiative cooling effect which outweighs the warming from a larger increase in lower tropospheric humidity (e.g. Spencer and Braswell, 1997 ; Miskolczi, 2010 ).

143,3_3,0_0,"Nature absorbs 98.5% of the CO 2 that is emitted by nature and man. As CO 2 increases in the atmosphere, nature causes plant growth to increase via photosynthesis which is an endothermic (cooling) reaction. For every pound of biomass formed some 10,000 Btu are removed from the atmosphere. CO 2 is absorbed, and oxygen is liberated. Further, a doubling of CO 2 will increase the photosynthesis rate by 30 to 100%, depending on temperature and available moisture 8 . More CO 2 is absorbed by the plants due to the increased concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere available for conversion to carbohydrates. Nature therefore has in place a built-in mechanism to regulate the CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere that will always completely dwarf man's feeble attempts to regulate it. Further, no regulation is necessary because CO 2 is not a pollutant; it is part of the animal-plant life cycle. Without it, life would not exist on earth.",First Step: 0 -- Second Step: None

The result is that the tourist industry, and then not whatever local attraction there is, but also hotels, restaurants, cafes and other business are severely hurt, sometimes into the next season, when even booked parties cancel.

To address these issues, we applied a semi-empirical approach that combines climate observations and model simulations to estimate Atlantic- and Pacific-based internal multidecadal variability (termed AMO and PMO, respectively). Using this method, the AMO and PMO are found to explain a large proportion of internal variability in Northern Hemisphere mean temperatures. Competition between a modest positive peak in the AMO and a substantially negative-trending PMO are seen to produce a slowdown or false pause in warming of the past decade.",First Step: 0 -- Second Step: None

It is unclear what form such a federal energy plan would take, as nothing of this sort (i.e., EPA trying to set national electricity policy) has ever before been attempted under the Clean Air Act. As part of next week's rollout, the EPA is expected to propose a generic federal takeover of a state's energy sector.

Greater utilization of sunlight in CO 2 -enriched plantlets likely contributed to tissue starch contents that were nearly 20-fold higher than those measured in control plantlets.

Moving the state into the middle of the electric market will only create a host of new problems. The state cannot build power plants faster, cheaper, or more efficiently than the private sector. The state cannot set prices better than the private sector. The state can, however, spend the taxpayer's money faster than the taxpayer could. Other states, such as Pennsylvania, and other countriesEngland, for examplehave made a success of electrical deregulation. California could too.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) only consider changes in the irradiance portion of incoming solar energy (insolation). They claim that, up to 1950, it explained over 50 percent of temperature variation; then, CO2 became 90 percent of the cause of change. Part of the reason for downplaying irradiance is the low percentage of change in modern records. The earliest record from outside the atmosphere from a manned observatory was Skylab (19731979). Skylab showed a change of 0.14% in the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI). An average over time shows a variation of 0.1% for an 11 year sunspot cycle.

The experimental method consisted of Skiron/Eta model integrations with coarse and fine grid increment using artificially-modified as well as analysis SST forcing. The selected period was AugustOctober 1997. Model simulations with coarse grid increment produced a weak signal in the precipitation pattern and the synoptic scale circulation over Europe, implying a damping of the North Atlantic atmospheric response to the tropical Pacific SST perturbation. Fine resolution experiments suggested an amplified dynamic response providing a direct link between tropical Pacific SST and North Atlantic synoptic circulation. The output signal is mainly attributed to the effective representation of the regional/ mesoscale atmospheric features due to the model implementation with a fine mesh grid.",First Step: 0 -- Second Step: None

Some other atmospheric changes promoting hurricanes that accompanied the AMO, such as the decrease in stability, are opposite to what one would expect from global warming. SSTs have also likely warmed a bit from anthropogenic enhancements to the earths greenhouse effect. And these elevated SSTs may be having an impact on Atlantic hurricanes (see for example our recent paper published in Geophysical Research Letters (Michaels et al., 2006) which is available here ).

And at low solar activity, it generates precisely the pattern in the wintertime that weve been seeing since 2006: The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which impacts the temperature in the Eurasian region especially in the wintertime, is controlled and effected by the UV radiation of the sun. When there is less solar activity, it gets colder in the region. This is precisely what we are observing, and the large part of the deviation observed in the pure GHG models stems precisely from that.

1616,5_1,-1,"These disclosures highlight a key fact with respect to global temperature data: the data sets are utterly lacking in integrity. Global warming alarmists confidently announce that worldwide temperatures have risen by, say .1 degree over a decade. It would be extraordinarily difficult to take measurements at many locations around the globe that would actually demonstrate that proposition. But the real situation is much worse: no one tells you what temperatures were actually measured at the worlds weather stations. Rather, they report claims of global warming based on adjusted temperature dataadjusted by alarmists, with the systematic purpose of manufacturing a rising temperature trend. If you subtract the adjustments, it may well be that there has been no net warming over the last 100 years at all.","First Step: 1 Input: The Earth's climate is changing, but it's not because of human activity.

1692,5_2,-1,"There is a famous quote in the Climategate emails from Trenberth about the travesty that there is missing heat which we cant account for. This refers to the fact that the radiation balance as understood and as modeled implies that the Earth should be absorbing radiation and warming up. The observed rate of warming, including heat stored in the ocean, is significantly less than predicted. This is the travesty. Please note that the adjustment of the OHC data in the above plot (black line after 2002) makes the missing heat term larger by a significant amount. The problem of balancing the Earth energy budget remains unsolved.

This illustrates that global surface temperatures are capable of warming at a rate that is three times higher than the forcing.

The next day, the EPA issued a statement declaring that the rule would be implemented as planned on November 16 . The MACT (Maximum Achievable Control Technology) rule condenses potential future coal-fueled power plant improvements and upgrades into an unachievable timeline. As a result of the Utility MACT rule, electricity providers already have outlined which coal-fueled power plants will be shut down.

(After accounting for temporal autocorrelation, this p value rises slightly to p < .128). If one assumes a positive relationship between ring measure and temperature (i.e. one tailed test), the expected number of sites meeting this criterion is: 1209 * .128 = 155.

Certainly water temperature increases in the lower reef around Heron Island are causing impacts already as the frequency of increased water temperatures increases. In a double whammy the water chemistry of the reef may become more acidic from increased atmospheric carbon dioxide. This threatens the corals ability to secrete exoskeletons and grow. Can corals learn to adapt to these new conditions? Certainly experience on other reef systems suggests that coral can expel heat sensitive algae and replace them with heat tolerant strains.

2135,0_0,0_0,The failure to use income after taxes and transfers cannot be accidental. It seems to be a deliberate attempt to mislead the public. And it is not the only misuse of data. Much of the recent large rise in the income received by the top 1 or 10 percent results from the Federal Reserve's policy of lowering interest rates and raising housing and stock prices. Higher stock prices increase the incomes of those who own shares. Middle-income earners do not have large stock or bond portfolios. Their shares are mainly part of corporate pension plans. The rise in stock prices benefits the middle class by increasing the support for their future pensions. But the gain is part of their wealth and not part of their current income. So the rise in stock prices widens the spread in the income distribution and contributes to the clamor. That's measurement with little or no substantive effect.,First Step: 0 -- Second Step: None

Letwin asked Lawson The UK Met Office has revised itsglobal temperature predictionsas a result of a new version of its climate model and climate simulations using it. It now believes that global temperatures up to 2017 will most likely be 0.43 deg C above the 1971 -2000 average, with an error of +/- 0.15 deg C. In reality this is a forecast of no increase in global temperatures above current levels. If the latest Met Office prediction is correct, and it accords far more closely with the observed data than previous predictions, then it will prove to be a lesson in humility. It will show that the previous predictions that were given so confidently as advice to the UK government and so unquestioningly accepted by the media, were wrong, and that the so-called sceptics who were derided for questioning them were actually on the right track. --David Whitehouse, The Global Warming Policy Foundation, 7 January 2013",First Step: 1 -- Second Step: 0

2583,0_0,0_0,"I'm having a theological discussion with a corn farmer in southern Missouri, 200 miles from the Corn Belt. My fellow farmer has enough flat ground to plant a few acres of corn, and she and I are deep in the weeds of the contentious subject of seeds. She maintains that the Bible is explicit in forbidding the use of genes from non-corn plants in the breeding of corn seeds, based on Leviticus 19:19, which prohibits seeding fields with two kinds of plants. I point out that humans share 50 percent of their genes with bananas. This does not impress her. She informs me that she doesn't buy food made from GMOs. Even while she avoids GMOs in her family diet, she plants them in her corn field. The conversation is far past the boundaries of what could be called productive, so I don't pursue how she squares her biblical beliefs with her agronomic choices.",First Step: 0 -- Second Step: None
